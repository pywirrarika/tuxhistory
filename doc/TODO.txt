TODO.txt for "tuxhistory"

2010.August
These are the main (difficult) issues we would like to tackle
at some point:

* Make AI costumizable with Lua scripts
* Write a complete flexible GUI for tuxhistory. We need a panel that 
    chenges automaticly from the input from the objects xml file.
* Better rendering of terrain. 
* Anime the trasnitions of units when moving, working and combating.
* Load images from files on the fly, with a reference from the xml file.
* Improve the game performance.
