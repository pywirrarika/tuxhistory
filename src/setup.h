/*
  setup.h

  For TuxMath
  Contains functions to initialize the settings structs, 
  read in command-line arguments, and to clean up on exit.
  All code involving file I/O has been moved to fileops.h/fileops.c
  and is called from the main setup function.

  Some globals are declared in setup.c - all globals throughout tuxmath
  are now extern'd in the same place in tuxmath.h
